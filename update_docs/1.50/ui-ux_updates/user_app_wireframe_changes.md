- Added telemetry markers identifying tap/click targets for instrumentation (widget open, personalization toggle, AI prompt launch).
- Defined offline fallback states with skeleton loaders and cached data indicators.

## Directory & Org Chart
- Created split-view layout: search filters anchored at top, results list pinned, profile preview accessible via bottom sheet.
- Integrated celebration ribbon at top of directory search results for quick recognition actions.
- Added org chart carousel with pinch-to-zoom guidance and manager summary cards.

## Knowledge & Document Hub
- Implemented two-tab layout (Knowledge, Documents) with quick filters and recently viewed list.
- Document viewer wireframe includes version history, attestation CTA, and download options for offline mode.
- Added AI summary banner and key contact chips for each knowledge article.

## Service Hub Mobile Requests
- Redesigned intake wizard with progress indicator, SLA chip, and contextual help button.
- Added request timeline view for status tracking, with ability to escalate or add notes.

## Accessibility Considerations
- Ensured minimum tap target 44x44px; defined focus order for keyboard and assistive technology users.
- Documented high-contrast mode overlays and alternative icon set for reduced motion preferences.
