# Provider App Wireframe Changes — Version 1.50

Although provider-facing functionality has been retired, the design artefacts now preserve an archival record and highlight successor experiences for internal teams.

## Archival Snapshot
- Documented final state of provider dashboards with annotations describing retired widgets, metrics, and navigation paths.
- Added warning overlays instructing viewers that the flows are historical and replaced by internal partner dashboards.

## Successor Experience Mapping
- Linked each retired provider interaction to the new internal operations equivalent:
  - Provider task inbox → Service Hub Operations Queue.
  - Provider communication threads → Unified Messaging workspace.
  - Provider profile management → Operations Admin console.
- Provided step-by-step migration guidance for internal staff to support partners using the new tooling.

## Accessibility & Compliance Notes
- Marked outdated colour palettes and typography that do not meet WCAG 2.2; ensures no legacy asset is accidentally reused.
- Added compliance annotation referencing data retention policy for provider records.

## Documentation Distribution
- Uploaded annotated wireframes to `Archive → Provider` board in Figma with read-only permissions.
- Cross-referenced artefacts in Confluence knowledge base entry `Provider Wind-down Playbook`.
