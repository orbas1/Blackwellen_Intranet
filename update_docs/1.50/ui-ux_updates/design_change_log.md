# Version 1.50 Design Change Log

## Overview
Version 1.50 modernises the Blackwellen intranet experience across web and native channels. The release focuses on the adaptive home dashboard, service hub, employee intelligence features, analytics enablement, and administrative tooling. The design effort introduces a refreshed grid system, colour tokens, typography scale, component updates, accessibility improvements, research-backed interaction principles, and expanded documentation to support rapid iteration and compliance.

## Global Design System Updates
- **Layout Grid**: Adopted an 8px base grid with responsive breakpoints at 360px, 480px, 600px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px, and 1600px. All new layouts reference these breakpoints for consistent spacing, component scaling, and content density.
- **Colour Palette**: Introduced neutral “Granite” ramp (N0–N950) and accent colours “Aurora” (primary), “Harbour” (secondary), and “Catalyst” (status) to support analytics and service modules. Updated semantic usage guidelines for text/background contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large headings) and provided swatch pairings for charts, alerts, and banners.
- **Typography**: Established modular scale using Inter for interface text (weights 400/500/600/700) and Source Serif for long-form knowledge content (weights 400/600). Defined tokenised styles: Display 48/56, Hero 40/48, Heading 32/40, Subheading 24/32, Title 20/28, Body 16/24, Supporting 14/20, Micro 12/18. Added responsive typography ramps for tablet/mobile contexts.
- **Iconography**: Migrated to stroke-based “Outline 2.0” icon set for clarity at smaller sizes. Icons exported as 20px, 24px, and 32px assets with filled variants for notifications and status chips. Documented do/don’t usage for duotone and filled hybrids.
- **Spacing & Elevation**: Updated spacing tokens (xxs=2px, xs=4px, sm=8px, md=12px, base=16px, lg=24px, xl=32px, xxl=48px, xxxl=64px) and elevation scale (E0–E6) to standardise cards, drawers, and modals. Provided sample shadows with both light and dark theme contrast.
- **States & Feedback**: Documented hover, focus, pressed, selected, and disabled states for primary/secondary buttons, tertiary actions, tabs, and chips. Added motion guidance (200ms ease-out for entrances, 150ms ease-in for exits, 400ms spring for drag interactions) plus accessibility alternatives.
- **Content Strategy Alignment**: Updated microcopy patterns, tone ladders, and localisation placeholders to reduce ambiguity across approvals, compliance notices, and AI assistant prompts.

## Accessibility & Internationalisation Enhancements
- Minimum tap target increased to 44x44px on mobile and 32x32px on web, with guidance on padding vs visual bounds.
- Keyboard navigation order documented for dashboards, forms, modals, and drawers; skip links added to main content areas and analytics visualisations.
- Screen reader labels defined for adaptive widgets, knowledge cards, analytics charts, and AI insight tooltips. Added ARIA live region standards for validation and alert messages.
- Localisation guidelines capture truncation rules, dynamic text expansion buffers (20–30%), and RTL mirroring for navigation, tables, and chart legends. Added language-specific typographic fallbacks for Japanese and Arabic scripts.
- High-contrast and reduced motion modes audited with recommended contrast palettes and alternative animation timing.

## Component Library Changes
- **Cards**: New adaptive widget card with header, metric badge, quick action slots, and contextual footers. Cards support density modes (comfort, compact, analytics) and responsive behaviour (stack vs grid) documented with breakpoints.
- **Navigation**: Introduced left-rail navigation for service hub, persistent top utility bar, collapsible quick launcher for mobile parity, and breadcrumb component with overflow management. Added responsive behaviour for mega menu on narrow widths.
- **Tables & Lists**: Added progressive disclosure pattern for dense analytics tables, including sticky headers, inline filters, row expansion, and keyboard shortcuts.
- **Forms**: Refreshed input, dropdown, date picker, and segmented control styles. Inline validation messaging relocated beneath fields with colour-coded status icons and ARIA bindings. Added upload component with drag-and-drop and progress states.
- **Notifications**: Standardised toast placement (top-right web, bottom mobile) with severity-specific colour tokens and annunciator icons. Added in-product messaging component for longer-form updates with dismiss and snooze behaviours.
- **Assistant Drawer**: Documented cross-platform behaviour, including suggested prompts carousel, action chips, and conversation transcript handling.
- **Data Visualisation**: Expanded chart library specs for KPI tiles, line/bar combo charts, heatmaps, and risk matrices with pattern overlays for accessibility.

## Detailed Module Updates
### Adaptive Home Dashboard
- Redesigned widget layout with three-column web grid (12/6/6 or 8/8/8 across breakpoints) and carousel-based mobile alternative. Includes pinned insights region for AI recommendations and quick action toolbar for create/log/launch tasks.
- Widgets now expose configuration icon, enabling quick filter adjustments, timeframe changes, and layout toggles without leaving the dashboard.
- Added contextual onboarding overlays guiding first-time users through widget personalisation and assistant usage.

### Employee Directory & Profiles
- Introduced hero section with photo, role badges, skills tags, and contact chips. Org chart view uses layered cards with breadcrumbs, expand/collapse animation, and quick filters (team size, tenure, location).
- Profile timeline consolidates recognitions, projects, and performance milestones in vertical chronological layout with status icons.
- Added shared note drawer allowing managers to leave private notes with permission controls.

### Knowledge Hub & Document Viewer
