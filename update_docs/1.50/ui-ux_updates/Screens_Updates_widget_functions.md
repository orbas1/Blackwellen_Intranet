> **Update (06 May 2024)**: Widget interactions now emit telemetry events (`dashboard.widgets.loaded`, `dashboard.widgets.reordered`, `dashboard.manual-refresh`) and display offline provenance badges when the dashboard falls back to cached data. Personalisation drawer governs density, visibility, and quick action catalogues with accessibility announcements for reorder and toggle actions.
