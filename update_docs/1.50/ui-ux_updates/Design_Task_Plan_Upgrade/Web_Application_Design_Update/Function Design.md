# Functional Design Overview

## Core User Journeys
1. **Provider Oversight**
   - Landing on dashboard reveals metrics: Active Providers, Compliance Alerts, Pending Approvals.
   - User can filter by region (multi-select) and time range (date picker) with instantaneous chart updates.
   - Clicking metric card drills into provider list (table) with bulk approval actions.
2. **Resource Management**
   - Global navigation > Resources. Grid of document cards with filters (type, department, updated date).
   - Upload modal supports drag-and-drop, metadata tagging, permission assignment.
3. **Settings Customization**
   - Accessed via avatar dropdown. Drawer contains tabs (Profile, Notifications, Integrations, Security).
   - Each tab uses consistent form patterns; security tab features 2FA toggles, session log table.
4. **Support Ticketing**
   - Quick action button top-right triggers modal to create ticket (title, description, priority).
   - After submission, toast confirms, and activity timeline updates in real time.

## Role-Based Interfaces
- **Administrators:** full access, view analytics, manage users, modify settings.
- **Managers:** limited to assigned departments; see aggregated stats but restricted edit controls.
- **Contributors:** view dashboards, submit updates, limited editing on own content.

## Error Handling
- Inline inline notifications for recoverable issues; full-page error (illustration + CTA) for system failures.
- Retry patterns: display "Retry" button on toasts and inline statuses.

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy-load heavy charts beyond first viewport; skeleton placeholders for 400ms min.
- Use caching for navigation search suggestions (debounced 250ms).

## Security UX
- Show session timeout warning modal 2 minutes before expiration with countdown.
- Display security badge icon when data is encrypted or secure operations invoked.
