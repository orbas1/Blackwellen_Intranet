# Card Layout Patterns

## Dashboard Overview Grid
- Place metric cards in 3-column grid on desktop (gutter 24px). Each row capped at 3 cards to maintain readability.
- On tablet (â‰¥768px <1024px), 2-column grid with 24px vertical spacing. On mobile, stack with 16px spacing and center align.

## Detail Panels
- Use 12-column span of 6 columns for detail cards containing charts or forms; 32px spacing between paired cards.
- When combined with tables, align card height to table header (64px) to create visual rhythm.

## Interaction Rules
- Card actions appear as icon button in top-right; clicking reveals context menu (280px) anchored to card.
- Entire card clickable for navigation only if designated `card--link` variant; include arrow indicator bottom-right.

## Content Density
- Maximum 120 words per card; use bullet lists with 12px left indent.
- Embed charts sized 240px height with 16px padding inside card body.
