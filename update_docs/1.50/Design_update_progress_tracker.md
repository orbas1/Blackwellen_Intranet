# Version 1.50 Design Progress Tracker

| Metric | Score (%) | Status Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 42 | Foundational tokens refreshed but cross-platform component parity still in review; requires iterative QA. |
| Design Organisation | 55 | Governance framework drafted; documentation structure exists, yet asset repositories still being consolidated. |
| Design Position | 38 | Navigation hierarchy concepts approved, however stakeholder alignment on contextual placement is pending. |
| Design Text Grade | 46 | Copy decks partially updated; compliance/legal review outstanding for AI and analytics messaging. |
| Design Colour Grade | 50 | Core palette updated with emo variants, but accessibility validation for departmental themes incomplete. |
| Design Render Grade | 33 | High-fidelity prototypes in progress; several complex dashboards lack final visual refinements. |
| Compliance Grade | 45 | Baseline checklists defined, yet formal sign-off from governance teams not secured. |
| Security Grade | 40 | Security cues integrated conceptually; needs penetration of consent prompts and encryption indicators into all layouts. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 48 | Interaction specs drafted, but engineering feasibility walkthroughs outstanding for widget personalisation. |
| Design Images Grade | 52 | Asset curation underway with new imagery sets identified; optimisation and CDN strategy pending. |
| Design Usability Grade | 30 | Usability testing not yet conducted; only heuristic reviews performed. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 35 | Early QA passes reveal inconsistencies in component states and spacing; remediation backlog active. |
| Test Grade | 32 | Automated visual and accessibility testing frameworks not fully configured; planning stage only. |
| QA Grade | 36 | Design QA checklist drafted; execution blocked until engineering builds are available. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 44 | Requirements traceability matrix initiated, but prototype-to-requirement mapping incomplete. |
| Overall Grade | 41 | Design programme mid-flight with governance and tokens stabilising; substantial work remains across testing, usability, and compliance.

> **Next Review Date**: Align with Milestone 2 exit (Week 5) to reassess progress once core experience blueprints are approved.
