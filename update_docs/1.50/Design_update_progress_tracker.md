# Version 1.50 Design Progress Tracker

| Metric | Score (%) | Status Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 88 | Analytics control tower filters, KPI mosaics, alert workflows, and QA evidence markers embedded across adaptive home and service hub specs, raising fidelity across artefacts. |
| Design Organisation | 80 | Governance cadence embedded with PMO; analytics documentation and QA evidence register linked through update index and Confluence, giving stakeholders a single navigation spine. |
| Design Position | 74 | Navigation hierarchy validated against updated logic flows; analytics console tabs and assistant drawer paths mapped to persona entry points. |
| Design Text Grade | 66 | Copy decks expanded with alert acknowledgement messaging, AI assistant guardrails, and security posture tooltips pending final compliance redlines. |
| Design Colour Grade | 78 | Theme tokens now codified in runtime registry covering light/dark/emo/high-contrast variants with focus treatments and analytics palette notes traced to engineering specs. |
| Design Render Grade | 80 | High-fidelity prototypes refreshed for analytics control tower, assistant drawer, and mobile intelligence screen in addition to widget and service hub layouts. |
| Compliance Grade | 68 | Accessibility checklist refreshed, analytics data table fallbacks captured, and telemetry consent messaging documented for control tower interactions. |
| Security Grade | 65 | Security posture summaries, acknowledgement audit trails, and mobile hygiene indicators now specified; pending SecOps review for retention policy adjustments. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 82 | Widget provenance, offline messaging, analytics filter behaviours, quick action governance, service hub intake orchestration, and navigation-level theme switching flows documented with telemetry events. |
| Design Images Grade | 70 | Programmatic asset synthesis validated; analytics illustration briefs and SVG trend guidelines supplied for upcoming art production sprint. |
| Design Usability Grade | 72 | Usability plan now includes analytics filter stress tests, acknowledgement flows, security posture comprehension scenarios, and theme switcher discoverability exercises across desktop and mobile contexts. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 68 | Design QA checklist extended to cover analytics charts, filter keyboard paths, assistant prompts, and linked to QA defect tracker for wave reporting. |
| Test Grade | 78 | Chromatic baseline suite, Lighthouse thresholds, axe CI packs, and Detox evidence mapped to master test plan with traceability from design artefacts. |
| QA Grade | 76 | QA collaboration cadence expanded to analytics and mobile intelligence flows with annotated datasets, parity checkpoints, and UAT facilitation scripts consumed by departmental champions. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 78 | Traceability matrix references analytics console artefacts, mobile parity notes, and telemetry schemas with cross-links to engineering stories. |
| Overall Grade | 82 | Governance alignment complete; analytics documentation lifts release readiness while theme orchestration specs, QA evidence mapping, and UAT facilitation accelerate sign-off, with asset polish and compliance sign-off next. |

> **Next Review Date**: Align with QA Wave 2 (Week 6) to validate OWASP outcomes, updated automation evidence, and final asset readiness.
