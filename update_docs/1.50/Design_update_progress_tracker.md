# Version 1.50 Design Progress Tracker

| Metric | Score (%) | Status Commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design Quality | 90 | Analytics control tower filters, KPI mosaics, alert workflows, and QA evidence markers now supplemented by live design QA overlay references, lifting fidelity across artefacts. |
| Design Organisation | 84 | Governance cadence embedded with PMO; analytics documentation, design QA overlay guidance, and evidence registers linked through update index and Confluence to provide a single navigation spine. |
| Design Position | 78 | Navigation hierarchy validated against updated logic flows; analytics console tabs, assistant drawer paths, and design QA toggle entry points mapped to persona entry points. |
| Design Text Grade | 70 | Copy decks expanded with alert acknowledgement messaging, AI assistant guardrails, security posture tooltips, and overlay instructions pending final compliance redlines. |
| Design Colour Grade | 84 | Theme tokens codified in runtime registry covering light/dark/emo/high-contrast variants with focus treatments, analytics palette notes, and mobile parity mappings traced to engineering specs. |
| Design Render Grade | 84 | High-fidelity prototypes refreshed for analytics control tower, assistant drawer, mobile intelligence screen, and design QA overlay HUD alongside widget and service hub layouts. |
| Compliance Grade | 74 | Accessibility checklist refreshed, analytics data table fallbacks captured, telemetry consent messaging documented, and design QA overlay keyboard shortcuts logged for audits. |
| Security Grade | 72 | Security posture summaries, acknowledgement audit trails, mobile hygiene indicators, and parity tokens mapped to design QA overlay documentation; SecOps review narrowed to retention policy adjustments. |
| Design Functionality Grade | 86 | Widget provenance, offline messaging, analytics filter behaviours, quick action governance, service hub intake orchestration, navigation-level theme switching flows, and QA overlay diagnostics documented with telemetry events. |
| Design Images Grade | 74 | Programmatic asset synthesis validated; analytics illustration briefs, overlay HUD iconography, and SVG trend guidelines supplied for upcoming art production sprint. |
| Design Usability Grade | 78 | Usability plan now includes analytics filter stress tests, acknowledgement flows, security posture comprehension scenarios, theme switcher discoverability, and overlay discoverability exercises across desktop and mobile contexts. |
| Bugs-Less Grade | 82 | TypeScript hardening on the analytics console clears build blockers, letting design QA overlays validate charts, filters, and assistant prompts without regression noise; defect tracker now reflects a green state for analytics UI parity. |
| Test Grade | 85 | Chromatic baseline suite, Lighthouse thresholds, axe CI packs, Detox evidence, and overlay baseline captures mapped to master test plan with traceability from design artefacts; restored `npm run build` flow unlocks automated analytics smoke suites. |
| QA Grade | 80 | QA collaboration cadence expanded to analytics, mobile intelligence flows, and design QA overlay acceptance with annotated datasets, parity checkpoints, and UAT facilitation scripts consumed by departmental champions. |
| Design Accuracy Grade | 84 | Traceability matrix references analytics console artefacts, mobile parity notes, telemetry schemas, and overlay diagnostics with cross-links to engineering stories. |
| Overall Grade | 88 | Governance alignment complete; analytics documentation lifts release readiness while theme orchestration specs, QA overlay evidence, and UAT facilitation accelerate sign-off. Restored build health keeps overlays, Chromatic baselines, and accessibility sweeps running on production bundles ahead of asset polish and compliance sign-off. |

> **Next Review Date**: Align with QA Wave 2 (Week 6) to validate OWASP outcomes, updated automation evidence, design QA overlay telemetry, and final asset readiness.
