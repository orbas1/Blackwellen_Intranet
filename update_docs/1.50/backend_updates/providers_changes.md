# Provider Module Changes â€” Version 1.50

- Removed all provider module bindings from service container; provider-specific repositories detached from dependency graph.
- Archived provider configuration entries in database table `providers` with status `retired` and retention expiry `2025-06-30` per compliance policy.
- Updated seeding scripts to prevent re-creation of provider roles or permissions; migrations include clean-up for orphaned provider references in `users` table.
- Notification templates referencing providers replaced with generic partner messaging stored under `notifications/templates/partners`.
- Added migration verification queries ensuring zero active sessions tied to provider accounts before decommissioning.
- Documented rollback plan allowing reactivation via feature flag `provider-legacy-mode` (disabled by default) to support emergency reinstatement during deprecation window.
