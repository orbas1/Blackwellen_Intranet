# Backend Change Log â€” Version 1.50

## Highlights
- Delivered adaptive home, directory intelligence, knowledge hub, service hub, analytics, and AI controller/service changes with production-ready telemetry and feature flag coverage.
- Decommissioned all provider-specific controllers and routes; responses now emit HTTP 410 with migration links and sunset headers.
- Published REST, GraphQL, and gRPC contract updates with comprehensive migration packs and automated communications to integrators.
- Hardened observability, caching, and workflow integrations to align with governance and dependency requirements.

## Risk & Mitigation Summary
- **AI assistant GPU allocation**: tracked as risk R-014; fallback plan uses CPU inference with reduced throughput if GPU cluster delayed.
- **Directory HRIS delta sync**: additional monitoring configured to detect event lag >5 minutes; alert thresholds tuned in Grafana.
- **Service hub integrations**: ERPNext connector has failover queue to hold requests if downstream outage occurs; operations notified via Opsgenie.

## Next Actions
- Monitor traffic on deprecated endpoints; escalate to partner success team if volumes remain above 5% after 15 May.
- Finalise production rollout schedule for adaptive home once personalisation experiments sign-off complete.
- Coordinate with QA to validate gRPC telemetry ingestion under load testing scenario scheduled for 2 May.
