# Version 1.50 Design Milestone Plan

## Milestone 1: Design System & Governance Foundation (Target: Week 2) â€” 20%
- **Objective**: Establish unified design tokens, accessibility baselines, and governance processes across application and web tracks.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Finalised colour, typography, spacing, and icon tokens mapped to implementation repositories.
  - Updated component inventory (cards, buttons, forms, menus, widgets) with usage guidelines and accessibility annotations.
  - Governance playbook covering review cadence, approval workflow, and partial template version control.
- **Entry Criteria**: Discovery assets reviewed; Figma libraries audited; accessibility standards approved by compliance.
- **Exit Criteria**: Tokens published to design system, documentation signed off, and engineering handover commenced.
- **Status (24 Apr)**: âœ… Complete â€” token libraries published, accessibility baseline signed off, governance cadence integrated with programme tracker.

## Milestone 2: Core Experience Blueprint Completion (Target: Week 5) â€” 45%
- **Objective**: Produce annotated layouts and interaction specs for adaptive home, service hub, knowledge, and analytics journeys.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - High-fidelity prototypes for provider and user app dashboards, directory, and service workflows.
  - Web homepage, microsite templates, and profile/settings experiences with theme variants.
  - Updated logic flow diagrams aligning user guidance, compliance checkpoints, and AI interactions.
- **Entry Criteria**: Milestone 1 artefacts baselined; personas and journey maps validated.
- **Exit Criteria**: Prototypes approved by stakeholders, usability testing scripts drafted, and backlog items created.
- **Status (09 May)**: ðŸŸ¢ On Track â€” analytics control tower documentation now includes dataset/timeframe/segment filters, KPI mosaics, AI assistant narratives, alert acknowledgements, and schedule governance notes alongside previously captured adaptive home, knowledge, and service hub artefacts.

## Milestone 3: Theming, Personalisation, and Asset Rollout (Target: Week 8) â€” 25%
- **Objective**: Implement adaptive themes, emo variants, and asset libraries while ensuring performance and accessibility compliance.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Theme matrix covering light/dark, emo, departmental palettes, and fallback configurations.
  - Optimised asset packs (imagery, vectors, icons) with performance budgets and CDN strategy.
  - Configuration guides for modular layouts, partial templates, and widget rails.
- **Entry Criteria**: Core layouts approved; design tokens integrated into staging environments.
- **Exit Criteria**: Theme QA complete, asset repository published, and integration notes delivered to engineering.
- **Status (03 May)**: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress â€” colour matrix and accessibility tests completed; deterministic mobile asset generation in place with optimisation of analytics imagery scheduled Week 5.

## Milestone 4: Design QA, Documentation, and Release Readiness (Target: Week 11) â€” 30%
- **Objective**: Validate build fidelity, accessibility, and compliance, and publish final documentation for launch support.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Design QA reports covering responsive behaviour, accessibility outcomes, and component parity across platforms.
  - Updated copy decks, localisation kits, and compliance annotations for regulated modules.
  - Final handover package including release notes, training materials, and governance checklists.
- **Entry Criteria**: Themes and assets integrated in development builds; usability feedback addressed.
- **Exit Criteria**: All critical issues resolved, documentation archived, and release sign-off secured from design authority.
- **Status (24 Apr)**: âšª Not Started â€” blocked until engineering builds incorporating new layouts are available.
