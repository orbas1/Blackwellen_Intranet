# Version 1.50 Update Plan

## Situation Analysis
- **Feature Expansion Goals**: Version 1.50 introduces the adaptive home experience, unified employee intelligence, document and knowledge hub, cross-department service hub, analytics and AI layer, mobile enablement, and investment management extension defined in the feature briefs and update plan. These capabilities require coordinated delivery across backend services, data models, UI/UX, and mobile clients.
- **Issue Landscape**: Pre-update evaluations uncovered fifteen critical issues including missing backend documentation, absent regression planning, incomplete dependency governance, unscoped database migrations, insufficient frontend and mobile readiness, and cross-cutting security gaps. Each issue is mapped to remediation tasks to avoid regressions and compliance failures.
- **Strategic Response**: The update plan blends feature delivery with remediation, prioritising governance, architecture alignment, secure implementation, rigorous testing, and documentation to support a safe launch and informed operations handover.

## Objectives
1. Close all documented readiness gaps (backend, dependency, database, frontend, mobile, security) before feature development exits stabilization.
2. Deliver the complete Version 1.50 feature set with integration coverage for backend, frontend, user phone app, database, API, logic, and design layers.
3. Establish automated and manual quality-control pipelines with full reporting, culminating in an end-of-update report and changelog.
4. Provide stakeholder enablement materials (training, communications, release notes) aligned with rollout milestones and compliance requirements.
