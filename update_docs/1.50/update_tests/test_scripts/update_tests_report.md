## Overview
- **Test Window**: 08â€“11 May 2024
- **Coverage**: Backend, frontend, mobile, database, security, accessibility, performance, failover, UAT
- **Overall Status**: ðŸŸ¢ On Track

## Highlights
1. Master test plan executed across qa-green environment with > 97% of planned suites completed across automated and manual scripts.
2. Security orchestration script executed (Snyk, npm audit, composer audit, Trivy, Gitleaks, OWASP ZAP) with all high/critical findings remediated and reports filed under `reports/security`.
3. k6 load tests validated service hub latency targets under 90 req/s browse and 60 concurrent workflow submissions; PostgreSQL failover drill completed within 46 seconds.
4. Accessibility audits delivered Lighthouse Accessibility score of 98 and axe CI zero violations on adaptive home and analytics console; analytics palette contrast improvements verified via Chromatic `#2215`.
5. UAT Wave 1 & 2 sessions completed with four departments signing off and Finance conditional approval pending export enhancement (`UAT-215`).
6. Playwright multi-browser suite now runs against preview builds, capturing keyboard-driven widget reordering traces and videos for CAB evidence while persisting layout assertions for regression coverage.
