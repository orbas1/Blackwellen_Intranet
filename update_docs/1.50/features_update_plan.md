# Orbas CRM v1.50 – Feature Update Plan

## 1. Planning & Discovery
1. **Stakeholder & vision alignment**
   - Facilitate workshops with product, engineering, QA, CX, marketing, finance, and partner enablement leaders to validate Salesforce/Monday parity list and prioritise differentiators (AI copilot, marketplace, SaaS toggle).
   - Confirm CodeCanyon licensing deliverables, SaaS packaging tiers, and reseller enablement strategy.
2. **Persona & journey mapping**
   - Document end-to-end journeys for sales reps, marketers, service agents, project managers, finance controllers, HR admins, operations managers, field technicians, partners, and customers.
   - Capture cross-channel touchpoints (web app, mobile, portal, email, telephony, social) and identify required SLAs and AI assist moments.
3. **Requirements engineering**
   - Break feature backlog into epics → capabilities → user stories with acceptance criteria and dependencies.
   - Produce comprehensive feature parity matrix (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Monday.com) to ensure coverage and highlight Orbas differentiators.
   - Define non-functional KPIs: performance (<3s SPA load, <1s P95 API), uptime (99.9%), mobile offline tolerance, AI accuracy targets, compliance audit thresholds.
4. **Program governance**
   - Stand up steering committee, architecture review board, and change control board.
   - Establish bi-weekly sprint cadence, PI planning schedule, release trains (alpha, beta, GA), and cross-track syncs (web, mobile, AI, data, QA).
5. **Success measurement framework**
   - Set launch OKRs (CSAT, adoption, revenue, marketplace apps, CodeCanyon score) and instrument analytics requirements from day one.

## 2. Architecture & Technical Design
1. **Solution blueprint**
   - Confirm Laravel 10 + React 18 SPA (Vite, Tailwind, component library) with modular domain packages and API-first design.
   - Define Flutter monorepo (Workforce + Customer apps) with shared core, offline sync layer, and design system parity.
   - Select database strategy (PostgreSQL with tenancy strategy: schema-per-tenant vs row-level security) and caching (Redis) with queue workers (Horizon).
2. **Domain & data modeling**
   - Build ERDs for CRM core, sales/marketing, service/support, projects, finance/accounting, HR/payroll, inventory/logistics, manufacturing, fleet, venue, SaaS management, AI artifacts, analytics, and compliance.
   - Define custom object/field metadata repository, formula engine expressions, workflow definitions, audit logs, and event bus schema.
   - Map data retention, archival, and backup policies per entity.
3. **Integration & extensibility architecture**
   - Design REST & GraphQL APIs, webhook/event bus (Pusher, Laravel Echo, or custom WebSocket), streaming architecture, API gateway, and throttling policies.
   - Produce integration adapters: email (IMAP/SMTP), calendar (Google/Outlook), telephony (Twilio/RingCentral/Aircall), payments (Stripe/PayPal), storage (Wasabi/R2/S3), marketing (Google Ads/Meta Ads), social (Facebook/Instagram/LinkedIn/Twitter), e-commerce (Shopify/WooCommerce), ERP (SAP/Oracle/ERPNext), AI providers (OpenAI/Nano Banana), analytics export (BI tools), and automation connectors (Zapier/n8n/Make).
   - Define marketplace app manifest schema, OAuth flows, sandbox packaging, versioning, and review/approval pipeline.
4. **Security, compliance & governance design**
   - Model RBAC hierarchy, permission sets, sharing rules, field-level security, IP restrictions, SSO (SAML/OAuth2), MFA/2FA, session management, audit logs, and login history.
   - Architect GDPR/CCPA tooling (consent logs, privacy requests, anonymisation), retention policies, backup/restore workflows, sandbox isolation, and CodeCanyon license enforcement microservice.
5. **DevOps, infrastructure & observability**
   - Provision Docker/Kubernetes infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions/GitLab), automated testing gates, static analysis (PHPStan/Psalm, ESLint), and quality metrics.
   - Implement observability stack (Prometheus/Grafana, ELK/Sentry), feature flag service, license verification service, configuration management, and secrets vault.
   - Define release pipelines for mobile (CI builds, automated tests, store deployment) and SaaS tenant upgrades.
