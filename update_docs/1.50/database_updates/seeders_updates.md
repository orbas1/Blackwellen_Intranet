# Seeder Updates — Version 1.50 Rollout

## New Seeders
1. **V150DemoSeeder**
   - Orchestrates execution order: `DepartmentSeeder`, `LocationSeeder`, `EmployeeProfileSeeder`, `WidgetSeeder`, `DocumentSeeder`, `ServiceCatalogSeeder`, `ServiceRequestSeeder`, `KnowledgeBaseSeeder`.
   - Applies tenant-aware context ensuring RBAC rules seeded with `tenant_id` references for multi-tenant environments.
2. **KnowledgeBaseSeeder**
   - Seeds 120 policy articles, 80 SOPs, and 40 FAQ entries with markdown content, attachments, and attestation requirements.
   - Includes `review_cycle_days` to drive compliance reminders and Slack automation.
3. **ServiceCatalogSeeder**
   - Generates 60 catalog items across HR, IT, Finance, Facilities with SLA definitions, approval flows, and automation hooks.
4. **AnalyticsMetricSeeder**
   - Seeds KPI definitions (`employee_engagement`, `sla_adherence`, `document_completeness`) with query templates and target thresholds.

## Data Integrity Guards
- Seeders idempotent via `updateOrCreate` and maintain deterministic ordering for reproducibility.
- Feature flags toggled automatically post-seed using `FeatureFlagSeeder` to expose preview widgets to internal tenant only.
- Seeder tests executed via `php artisan test --testsuite=Seeders` verifying counts, relationships, and sample data accuracy.

## Automation
- GitHub Actions job `seed-refresh.yml` runs nightly against staging, capturing dataset snapshot and uploading to S3 bucket `staging-seed-backups/v150`.
- On success, triggers Slack notification to `#data-eng` summarising record counts and anomalies.
