# Version 1.50 Design Plan

## Purpose
This design plan aligns the provider, user, and web applications with the Version 1.50 objectives by translating the `Application_Design_Update_Plan` and `Web_Application_Design_Update` artefacts into a coordinated execution roadmap. It accounts for new feature pillars, compliance requirements, accessibility mandates, and the introduction of adaptive themes, emo themes, and modular partial templates.

---

## Strategic Design Objectives
1. **Unify the Experience Ecosystem**: Synchronise design tokens, component behaviour, and navigation paradigms across native applications and the responsive web portal to deliver a seamless employee and administrator journey.
2. **Enable Adaptive Personalisation**: Provide flexible layouts, modular templates, and theme variants (including emo themes) that can be recomposed per department, role, or campaign without compromising governance or accessibility.
3. **Strengthen Trust & Compliance**: Embed compliance, security, and audit cues into content, layouts, and micro-interactions to maintain enterprise-grade assurance while surfacing analytics, AI, and service workflows.
4. **Optimise for Multi-Device Delivery**: Ensure each design decision extends gracefully to desktop, tablet, mobile web, and the user phone app by referencing shared component definitions, responsive breakpoints, and logic flows.

---

## Design Governance & Collaboration
- **Design Authority**: Establish a cross-functional council (Product Design, Brand, Accessibility, Security) to steward all updates documented in `Screens_Update_Plan.md`, `component_functions.md`, and related assets.
- **Artefact Management**: Centralise Figma boards, design tokens, and documentation using the inventory defined in `Cards.md`, `Forms.md`, `Menus.md`, `Fonts.md`, and `Colours.md` with version control mappings to Git repositories.
- **Review Cadence**: Conduct fortnightly design reviews covering application and web tracks, aligning with engineering sprint demos and QA checkpoints.
- **Compliance Alignment**: Partner with Legal, Privacy, and Security teams to validate copy decks, data visualisations, and consent flows before they progress from design to build.

## Application Experience Plan
### Navigation & Layout
- Roll out adaptive navigation patterns with mega menus, contextual breadcrumbs, and persona-specific quick actions based on `Organisation_and_positions` and `Screens_Update.md`.
- Reconfigure home, directory, knowledge, and service hub layouts using modular sections from `Screens_Update_Plan.md`, enabling partial updates without full page rebuilds.
- Introduce flexible sidebar and widget rails that can be toggled per role or department using configuration parameters defined in `Screens_Updates_widget_functions.md`.
- Deploy navigation-level theme and contrast controls with persisted preferences, quick-cycle shortcuts, and analytics-friendly telemetry (`ThemeSwitcher.tsx`, `Screens_Update.md`) so accessibility and campaign variants remain user-driven rather than admin overrides.

### Component & Interaction Model
- Standardise card, button, and form behaviours, referencing `Cards.md`, `Screen_buttons.md`, and `Forms.md` to ensure consistent states, loading patterns, and error handling.
- Expand widget library to cover analytics tiles, AI prompts, and service hub trackers, ensuring each component includes telemetry hooks and fallback states.
- Specify service hub intake wizard behaviours (catalog filters, SLA badge legend, knowledge sidebar, offline submission fallback) to align with operations readiness requirements.
- Specify adaptive home personalisation drawer patterns governing widget visibility, density modes, data freshness controls, quick action catalogues, and accessibility announcements for drag-and-drop interactions.
- Document offline messaging patterns (data provenance badges, stale warnings, connectivity banners) for directory, knowledge, and widget surfaces shared across web and mobile.
- Embed in-product guidance and tooltips tied to the new logic flows (`Logic_Flow_map.md`, `Logic_Flow_update.md`) to steer users through complex workflows.
- Finalise analytics control tower interactions covering dataset/timeframe/segment filters, KPI cards with inline trend sparklines, acknowledgement workflows for alerts, and guided scheduling toggles. Each state is paired with telemetry contracts and fallbacks for partially loaded datasets.

### Content & Visual Direction
- Apply refreshed typographic hierarchy defined in `Fonts.md` and `Screen_text.md`, ensuring legibility on high-density dashboards.
- Harmonise colour usage with updated palettes (`Colours.md`, `Screen_update_Screen_colours.md`), factoring in accessibility contrast, theme variants, and stateful cues (info, success, warning, danger).
- Curate imagery and iconography from `Screens_update_images_and_vectors.md` that reflects diverse personas and operations scenarios.
- Align analytics data visualisations with governance-approved palettes and legend hierarchies so KPI tiles, forecast charts, and security posture summaries remain readable across light, dark, and emo themes.

### Accessibility & Compliance
- Integrate WCAG 2.2 AA compliance checks into every screen, with special focus on keyboard navigation, focus indicators, and motion reduction for emo themes.
- Ensure privacy and security cues (consent badges, encryption labels, audit logs) are visually consistent across provider and user flows.
- Document compliance annotations for regulated modules (HR, Finance, Investment) with traceability to `Forms.md` and `Menus.md`.
- Capture analytics-specific accessibility guardrails, including keyboard navigation for filter chips, ARIA descriptions for SVG trendlines, and data table fallbacks for every chart or KPI tile.

## Web Experience Plan
### Theming & Layout Architecture
- Deploy the expanded SCSS/CSS token set (`Scss.md`, `Css.md`) to support light, dark, emo, and high-contrast modes with runtime switching and persisted user preferences.
- Surface the theme switcher pattern globally within the web shell, ensuring parity with native clients and aligning persistence rules with `PreferenceProvider` telemetry expectations.
- Reconstruct home and landing pages using modular slots defined in `Home page components.md`, `pages.md`, and `pages_list.md`, enabling marketing and operations teams to update content without developer involvement.
- Implement partial template rendering for microsites and departmental home pages, ensuring compatibility with the global navigation frame and analytics instrumentation.

### Component Library Alignment
- Align web card, button, and typography styles with application standards using `Cards.md.md`, `Colours.md`, and `text.md.md` while accommodating responsive breakpoints.
- Define component responsibilities (`component_functions.md`, `component_types.md`) for dashboards, profile modules, and resource galleries, including data loading states and error boundaries.
- Capture error boundary fallback treatments and profile drawer content hierarchy to maintain parity with production build behaviour.
- Extend profile and settings designs (`Profile Styling`, `Profile Look.md`, `Settings.md`) to support custom layouts, privacy controls, and cross-device synchronisation.
- Add analytics intelligence layouts that combine KPI mosaics, AI prompt drawers, and security posture summaries with deterministic spacing, ensuring parity with the implemented `AnalyticsConsole.tsx` scaffolding.

### Content & Asset Strategy
- Refresh hero imagery, iconography, and illustration sets via `Assets.md`, `images_and _vectors.md`, and `Resources.md` to reduce load times and maintain brand fidelity.
- Update copy frameworks for service hub, analytics, and AI features with tone guides, compliance disclaimers, and localisation guidelines.
- Implement content governance workflows ensuring partial updates are reviewed before publication, with instrumentation for analytics and experimentation.
- Add admin-ready playbooks for analytics alert messaging, schedule cadence descriptions, and device security posture guidance so support teams can explain KPI anomalies or posture failures without escalating to product.

### Accessibility & Performance
- Enforce semantic HTML structure, ARIA labelling, and focus management across new components, documenting expectations in `Function Design.md` and `Placement.md`.
- Conduct performance budgeting for asset-heavy pages, leveraging lazy loading and responsive imagery strategies outlined in `Home page images.md` and `images_and _vectors.md`.
- Validate theme variants for colour contrast, animation preferences, and text scaling prior to production release.
- Instrument analytics canvases with graceful degradation paths: trend SVGs expose data tables, 3D charts offer 2D alternatives, and assistant narratives default to plain text when generative features are disabled.

## Integration with Engineering & QA
- **Design-to-Dev Handover**: Provide annotated specs, responsive breakpoints, and component props in the design system repository, linked to build tasks in the engineering backlog. Cross-reference artefacts with the implemented `apps/web` and `apps/mobile` component libraries to enforce parity and catch deltas early.
- **Design QA**: Establish a design QA checklist that mirrors `Design_update_progress_tracker.md` metrics, enabling joint reviews with QA to verify fidelity, usability, and accessibility.
- **Testing Artefacts**: Supply reference snapshots and accessibility scripts for automated visual regression and contrast testing.
- **Documentation**: Maintain living documentation for each component, including usage guidelines, accessibility notes, and integration examples.
- **Analytics Verification Kit**: Deliver annotated datasets, filter mappings, and alert acknowledgement scripts so QA can validate the deterministic mock analytics service and cross-platform parity with the React Native analytics screen.
- **QA Evidence Mapping**: Link every critical screen to QA artefacts (Chromatic build IDs, Lighthouse report paths, Detox artifact directories) and Playwright coverage expectations documented in `update_docs/1.50/test_plan.md` so that release sign-off references explicit design acceptance evidence.
- **UAT Facilitation**: Provide script cards capturing success metrics, tone guidance, and accessibility prompts enabling departmental champions to validate experiences against the approved design baselines during UAT waves.
