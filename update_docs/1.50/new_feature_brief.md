# Orbas CRM v1.50 â€“ New Feature Brief

## 1. Executive Summary
Version 1.50 positions Orbas CRM as a fully-integrated customer, revenue, and operations cloud that surpasses Monday.com and matches Salesforce breadth for SMB and mid-market teams. The release ships a dual-platform experience (Laravel + React SPA for web, Flutter Workforce & Customer mobile apps) with complete feature parity, omnichannel collaboration, AI-first workflows, and enterprise-grade governance. Every capability is engineered to satisfy CodeCanyon licensing requirements, deliver a turnkey installation wizard with license validation, and enable white-label SaaS deployment so resellers can launch isolated tenants within hours.
