> **Overall Release Health**: Adaptive experience foundations now include production-grade widget personalisation, telemetry, offline provenance messaging, and navigation-level theme orchestration on the web dashboard alongside existing mobile parity. Service hub catalog and intake orchestration surface SLA telemetry, validation, and knowledge support, closing the first operations milestone. Analytics control tower documentation mirrors production—dataset/timeframe/segment filters, acknowledgement workflows, schedule governance, and security posture summaries—across web and mobile, unlocking QA test planning and design sign-off. Mobile branding assets continue to generate during build/start flows, reducing repository friction. QA Waves 1–2 completed with backend/newman/k6 suites, security automation (Snyk/Trivy/Gitleaks/ZAP), PostgreSQL failover drill (46 s recovery), Detox device matrix, and UAT sign-offs. Design QA overlay and cross-platform token harmonisation now equip teams with baseline grids, safe-area diagnostics, and parity evidence, accelerating accessibility audits while Finance export remediation and AI automation remain in focus.
Analytics TypeScript hardening restored `npm run build` reliability by removing deprecated `keepPreviousData` usage, guaranteeing typed cache updates for alert acknowledgements and report schedules, and clearing the outstanding CI failure so QA automation can resume on the analytics track.
