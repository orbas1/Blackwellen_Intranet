> **Overall Release Health**: Adaptive experience foundations now include production-grade widget personalisation, telemetry, and offline provenance messaging on the web dashboard alongside existing mobile parity. Service hub catalog and intake orchestration now surface SLA telemetry, validation, and knowledge support, closing the first operations milestone. Analytics control tower documentation now mirrors production—dataset/timeframe/segment filters, acknowledgement workflows, schedule governance, and security posture summaries—across web and mobile, unlocking QA test planning and design sign-off. Mobile branding assets continue to generate during build/start flows, reducing repository friction. Focus shifts to deeper AI automation, QA enablement, and remaining design harmonisation milestones.
