> **Overall Release Health**: Adaptive experience foundations now include production-grade widget personalisation, telemetry, and offline provenance messaging on the web dashboard alongside existing mobile parity. Service hub catalog and intake orchestration now surface SLA telemetry, validation, and knowledge support, closing the first operations milestone. Mobile branding assets continue to generate during build/start flows, reducing repository friction. Focus shifts to analytics, AI enablement, QA automation, and design system harmonisation for remaining milestones.
