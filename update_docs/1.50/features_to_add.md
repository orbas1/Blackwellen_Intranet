| Event Bus & Streaming | Domain events, event processing, queue workers, background jobs | `domain_events`, `event_consumers`, `queue_jobs` | `EventBusService`, `QueueWorker`, `StreamProcessor` |
| Automation Marketplace | Publish/share workflows, templates, integrations | `automation_templates`, `automation_installs` | `AutomationMarketplace`, `TemplateInstaller` |

**Additional Requirements:**
- CLI/SDK documentation, sample apps, unit test generators, deployment pipelines.
- Data retention, archival, purge policies configurable per entity.
- Usage analytics for developer APIs, quota enforcement, billing integration.

**Implementation Note:** All features must expose REST/GraphQL endpoints, emit domain events for the real-time event bus, register audit logs, and provide role-aware UI components. Each module requires comprehensive test coverage, documentation, onboarding tutorials, Flutter parity work packages, and CodeCanyon compliance sign-off.
