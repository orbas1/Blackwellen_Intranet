# User App Pre-Update Evaluation (v1.50)

## Source Materials Reviewed
- `update_docs/1.50/user_phone_app_updates/` – directory exists but contains only empty placeholders; no mobile release notes or build artifacts.
- `update_docs/1.50/change_log.md` – indicates provider phone app retirement; no direct references to the employee-facing user app.

## Functionality
- With no build notes or feature matrix, we cannot confirm whether the employee mobile/desktop app compensates for provider feature removal (e.g., links, notifications, workflows). Key flows might still reference provider assets.
- Lack of platform-specific validation (iOS, Android, PWA) leaves uncertainty about parity between channels and potential platform regressions.

## Usability
- No UX guidance or updated screenshots exist. Users may encounter dead navigation entries or legacy terminology referencing providers, eroding trust.
- Accessibility and localization impacts are unassessed; there is no confirmation that copy changes or translations were updated to reflect the new scope.

## Errors & Stability
- Crash/error monitoring plans (Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry, etc.) are missing. Without them, production issues tied to removed provider dependencies could go unnoticed.
- QA sign-off is absent: there is no test suite execution record, device coverage list, or beta feedback summary.

## Integration
- The app’s integration points (push notifications, deep links, offline storage) may still rely on provider identifiers. Without a compatibility audit, updates risk breaking notifications or syncing behaviour.
- App Store/Play Store metadata and backend configuration (feature flags, A/B experiments) are undocumented, complicating coordinated releases.

## Security
- No evidence that mobile tokens, stored credentials, or cached provider data have been purged. Residual secrets on devices could represent a security liability.
- Update packaging (code signing, version increments) lacks validation, leaving a potential gap for supply-chain or distribution issues.

## Alignment & Recommendations
- Documentation does not reflect the expected state of the user app in v1.50. Product direction (provider retirement) is not translated into actionable mobile deliverables.
- **Action Items:**
  - Produce platform-specific release notes, build numbers, and QA results covering the removal of provider artefacts.
  - Audit integrations (notifications, deep links, offline cache) to ensure no provider dependencies remain.
  - Confirm security measures: token revocation, credential scrub, and updated signing certificates if required.
