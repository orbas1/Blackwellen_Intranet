# Dependency Pre-Update Evaluation (v1.50)

## Source Materials Reviewed
- `update_docs/1.50/dependency_updates.md` – file exists but contains no dependency matrix, version targets, or migration guidance.
- `update_docs/1.50/change_log.md` – only records retirement of provider phone app artefacts; no package-level implications are described.

## Functionality
- With no dependency inventory we cannot verify that core frameworks (backend, front-end, mobile) remain compatible after provider removal. Hidden transitive dependencies could still reference the deprecated modules and break builds.
- Missing post-update sanity checks (linting, tests, bundle analysis) prevent us from ensuring functionality parity across the stack.

## Usability
- Consumer teams lack clarity on SDK changes, CLI adjustments, or tooling updates needed for daily workflows. Developers may discover breaking dependency bumps late in the sprint, increasing support overhead.
- No changelog annotations exist for documentation tooling, leading to confusion about how internal docs should be rebuilt or linted.

## Errors & Build Health
- Without lockfile diffs or upgrade notes there is no way to anticipate compilation/runtime warnings. Automated pipelines could start failing silently due to incompatible dependency versions or unresolved peer dependencies.
- There is no rollback plan or version pinning strategy, raising the risk that production deploys get stuck on partially upgraded packages.

## Integration
- Dependencies that power integrations (SSO libraries, API clients, message brokers) are not catalogued. We cannot ensure external systems remain interoperable post-update.
- Lack of environment-specific requirements (e.g., minimum Node/PHP versions) can destabilize CI/CD and local development environments.

## Security
- Security posture is unassessed: no CVE review, SCA scan summaries, or patch notes are provided. Critical vulnerabilities may remain unresolved or be introduced with unseen upgrades.
- There is no verification that provider-specific secrets or packages have been scrubbed, risking orphaned credentials and exposed attack surfaces.

## Alignment & Recommendations
- The current documentation set is misaligned with release expectations; stakeholders expect a dependency upgrade narrative but receive none.
- **Action Items:**
  - Publish a dependency matrix detailing current vs. target versions, along with compatibility notes.
  - Include security scan results (Snyk, Dependabot, etc.) and remediation steps for any flagged packages.
  - Provide upgrade/rollback procedures and confirm CI pipelines against the new dependency set before sign-off.
