# Pre-Update Issue Report — Version 1.50

## Overview
The pre-update evaluations for the 1.50 release reveal substantial readiness gaps across the backend, database, dependency, front-end, and user app workstreams. Documentation for the planned removal of provider-oriented functionality is incomplete, leaving delivery teams without actionable guidance. Testing, observability, and security work remain largely unscoped, creating a high risk of regressions and compliance issues at launch. The sections below consolidate the key deficiencies uncovered during the evaluations.

## Backend Readiness Gaps
Backend documentation does not describe how provider-specific logic will be removed or replaced. There are no endpoint diffs, controller/service plans, or regression checklists confirming that authentication, workflow automation, analytics, and integrations will remain stable. Without contract updates or deprecation messaging, dependent clients will have no indication of schema changes, and support teams will be unable to prepare mitigation guidance. Observability has also been neglected—there is no error-handling strategy, alert coverage, or monitoring updates to capture calls into deprecated routes. Finally, integration and security reviews have not been completed, leaving third-party connectors and dormant provider permissions unchecked.

## Dependency Governance Failures
The dependency track lacks any matrix of current versus target versions, security scan summaries, or rollout/rollback procedures. This prevents the team from verifying framework compatibility after provider removal and leaves CI/CD pipelines exposed to unexpected build failures. Development tooling impacts, such as SDK or CLI updates, are uncommunicated, and there is no evidence of version pinning or lockfile validation. The absence of CVE analysis and credential scrubbing for provider-specific packages introduces security debt that could propagate into production.

## Database Migration Risks
Database work has not progressed beyond placeholders. There is no migration dossier outlining the treatment of provider tables, constraints, or archival workflows, nor have dry-run results or rollback plans been documented. Reporting, analytics, and BI teams have not received updated ERDs, data dictionaries, or communications about dataset changes, risking broken dashboards and compliance violations. External integrations and ETL jobs consuming provider-related data lack remediation plans, and security measures such as role cleanup and historical data anonymisation remain undefined.

## Front-End Delivery Concerns
The front-end evaluation highlights a lack of component inventories, UX specifications, and regression coverage. Without updated wireframes, accessibility validation, or design sign-off, the UI may still reference retired provider flows, confusing end-users. Automated tests and manual QA evidence are missing, and there is no release note or known-issues log to prepare support teams. API contract validation has not been coordinated with backend changes, raising the risk of runtime failures when deprecated fields are requested. Third-party widgets and integrations also lack reconfiguration guidance.

## User App Preparedness Issues
For the employee-facing app, there are no platform-specific release notes, build artefacts, or feature matrices describing how provider dependencies will be removed. UX, accessibility, and localisation impacts have not been evaluated, and there is no record of QA runs, device coverage, or beta feedback. Monitoring and crash reporting plans (e.g., Sentry, Crashlytics) are absent, leaving the team blind to production incidents post-release. Integrations such as push notifications, deep links, and offline storage have not been audited for provider identifiers, and mobile security work (token revocation, credential purges, signing validation) is unplanned.

## Cross-Cutting Impact
Collectively, the lack of planning threatens delivery alignment and operational stability. Teams cannot coordinate release timing, risk acceptance, or stakeholder communications because the foundational artefacts—documentation, test evidence, and remediation strategies—are missing. Without corrective action across each workstream, the 1.50 update may ship with broken user experiences, data inconsistencies, and unresolved security exposures.
