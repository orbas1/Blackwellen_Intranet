# Fix Suggestions — Version 1.50 Pre-Update Evaluations

1. **Backend Remediation**
   1. Produce detailed update notes for each affected service/controller, including endpoint diffs, feature-flag plans, and explicit handling for retired provider flows.
   2. Build a regression checklist covering authentication, workflow automation, analytics, and integrations; execute smoke tests before code freeze.
   3. Publish API contract updates, versioning guidance, and deprecation messaging to all client teams, with timelines for removing provider schemas.
   4. Define observability enhancements—structured error handling, targeted logging, dashboards, and alerts—to capture traffic hitting deprecated routes.
   5. Audit third-party integrations and remove or reconfigure provider-specific connectors, confirming SLAs with partner systems.
   6. Complete a security sweep for backend roles, tokens, and permissions tied to provider personas, including revocation and access-matrix updates.

2. **Dependency Governance**
   1. Assemble a dependency matrix showing current vs. target versions, compatibility notes, and responsible owners for each stack layer.
   2. Run automated dependency health checks (lint, unit/integration tests, bundle analysis) in CI to validate upgrades and prevent build regressions.
   3. Execute security scans (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot, npm/yarn audit) and document remediation steps, ensuring provider-related packages are removed.
   4. Establish rollback and version pinning procedures, including lockfile updates and changelog entries for developer tooling impacts.

3. **Database Migration Readiness**
   1. Draft a migration dossier with DDL scripts, data archival procedures, constraint updates, and verification queries for provider-related entities.
   2. Schedule and document migration dry runs, capturing execution time, failure handling, and rollback outcomes.
   3. Update ERDs, data dictionaries, and reporting guidance; communicate changes to BI, analytics, and compliance stakeholders.
   4. Coordinate with integration owners to adjust ETL jobs, API payloads, and external data feeds affected by provider data removal.
   5. Review database security by retiring provider roles, cleaning residual credentials, and documenting anonymisation plans for historical data.

4. **Front-End Hardening**
   1. Catalogue all components and pages referencing provider data, pairing each with required code changes, screenshots, and copy updates.
   2. Refresh UX artefacts—wireframes, content strategy, accessibility checklists—and secure design sign-off for the new provider-free experience.
   3. Align API clients (REST/GraphQL) with the updated backend contracts, including schema validations and error-boundary updates.
   4. Expand automated and manual regression suites across supported browsers/devices, recording results and known issues for release readiness.
   5. Document configuration updates for third-party widgets or analytics tools that previously relied on provider context.

5. **User App Stabilisation**
   1. Create platform-specific release notes, build numbers, and change logs outlining how provider features are retired on iOS, Android, and desktop.
   2. Execute device-matrix testing (functional, UX, accessibility, localisation) and capture QA approvals with remediation tasks tracked to closure.
   3. Implement or update crash/error monitoring (Crashlytics, Sentry) with alerts tuned to flows replacing provider functionality.
   4. Audit integrations—push notifications, deep links, offline caches—to remove provider identifiers and validate end-to-end behaviour.
   5. Perform mobile security hygiene: purge cached credentials, rotate tokens, confirm signing certificates, and update store metadata.

6. **Cross-Cutting Release Management**
   1. Build an integrated release checklist aligning backend, database, front-end, and user app milestones with dependency upgrades and security tasks.
   2. Establish stakeholder communications (support, operations, compliance) summarising expected impacts, downtime windows, and fallback plans.
   3. Track completion via an update readiness dashboard that surfaces outstanding risks, owners, and target resolution dates.
