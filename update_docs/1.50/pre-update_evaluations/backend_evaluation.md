# Backend Pre-Update Evaluation (v1.50)

## Source Materials Reviewed
- `update_docs/1.50/backend_updates/` – currently contains only empty placeholders with no implementation notes or migration steps.
- `update_docs/1.50/change_log.md` – notes the retirement of the provider phone app artefacts but provides no backend remediation plan.

## Functionality
- Absence of endpoint specifications or controller/service changes means we cannot confirm how the removal of provider features affects request handling, scheduled jobs, or data exports. Critical workflows (authentication, HR processes, approvals) might still reference retired provider entities, risking runtime failures once 1.50 ships.
- No regression checklist exists to validate that backend modules still satisfy the intranet capabilities outlined in `intranet.md` (e.g., workflow automation, analytics, integrations). We need targeted smoke tests for each affected capability before approving deployment.

## Usability
- Without API contract documentation, consumer teams (front-end, integrations) have no guidance on response schema stability. Any silent field removals will degrade user-facing flows without warning.
- Lack of deprecation messaging or fallback behaviour for clients that previously relied on provider-related endpoints will cause confusing "feature missing" experiences across the intranet.

## Errors & Observability
- There is no error-handling review or logging plan capturing the retirement of provider logic. Missing guardrails (feature flags, explicit 410 responses, or redirect messaging) will translate into ambiguous 500/404 errors that are hard to triage.
- Monitoring updates are unspecified; we risk going live without dashboards or alerts tuned to catch calls into deprecated routes.

## Integration
- No integration mapping exists to confirm that third-party connectors (ERP, HRIS, SSO, messaging) are insulated from the removal. Shared provider identifiers may still be synced, leading to upstream sync failures.
- Event bus/webhook behaviour is undocumented. If provider-related topics are removed, subscribing systems will break without notice.

## Security
- There is no confirmation that permissions, roles, or tokens tied to provider personas have been purged or migrated. Dormant scopes could grant broader access than intended.
- Session and API key revocation plans for provider accounts are missing, creating a window where retired actors might still authenticate.

## Alignment & Recommendations
- The change log explains *what* was removed but not *how* the backend enforces the change. This misalignment between strategic decision and technical execution blocks sign-off.
- **Action Items:**
  - Populate the backend update files with concrete diffs, deprecation plans, and test cases.
  - Produce a regression checklist validating each major module post-removal.
  - Document integration impact assessments and communicate required client changes before deployment.
