# Front-End Pre-Update Evaluation (v1.50)

## Source Materials Reviewed
- `update_docs/1.50/frontend_updates/` – directory present but devoid of component inventories, UX specs, or testing notes.
- `update_docs/1.50/change_log.md` – mentions removal of provider phone app artefacts; no corresponding web UI remediation details supplied.

## Functionality
- Without component-level diffs we cannot assess how the web UI adapts to the absence of provider data. Pages may still expect provider-specific API responses, causing blank states or crashes.
- No cross-browser regression plan exists. Key intranet areas (dashboards, workflow tools, HR modules) risk degraded functionality on unsupported browsers or devices.

## Usability
- UX implications of removing provider features are unexplained. Navigation, labeling, and user guidance could still refer to provider flows, generating confusion for employees.
- No updated wireframes or accessibility checks are provided. We cannot ensure compliance with accessibility standards or design system consistency after the change.

## Errors & Quality Assurance
- There is no evidence of front-end automated testing (unit, integration, e2e) being rerun or updated. Error boundaries and empty states may not gracefully handle missing provider data.
- Release notes do not capture known issues or mitigations, preventing support teams from preparing communication to end-users.

## Integration
- Lack of API contract confirmations leaves uncertainty about how the front-end interacts with modified backend endpoints. GraphQL/REST queries might still request deprecated fields, resulting in runtime errors.
- Third-party widgets (calendars, analytics, chat) relying on provider context may fail without documented configuration changes.

## Security
- There is no review of front-end auth flows (SSO, RBAC gating) following the provider retirement. Residual UI elements might expose links to restricted resources or leak data via cached state.
- CSP, token storage, and session management changes are undocumented, leaving potential vulnerabilities unaddressed.

## Alignment & Recommendations
- Product intent (removing provider experience) is not backed by UI/UX execution plans, creating misalignment between strategy and delivery.
- **Action Items:**
  - Supply component update notes, screenshots, and accessibility test results demonstrating provider removal impacts.
  - Validate all API interactions against the updated backend, documenting required front-end refactors.
  - Publish a regression matrix covering supported browsers/devices and record sign-offs from design and QA stakeholders.
