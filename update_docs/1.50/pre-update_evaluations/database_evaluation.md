# Database Pre-Update Evaluation (v1.50)

## Source Materials Reviewed
- `update_docs/1.50/database_updates/` – directory exists but contains no migration scripts, schema diffs, or data governance notes.
- `update_docs/1.50/change_log.md` – confirms removal of provider phone app artefacts but does not address database impact.

## Functionality
- No migration plan details how provider-related tables, columns, or relationships are being handled. Dropping them without data archival could break reporting modules or foreign-key constraints.
- There is no validation strategy to ensure core workflows (approvals, HR records, analytics) operate with the updated schema.

## Usability
- Data consumers (BI team, analytics dashboards) lack guidance on changed datasets or decommissioned views. Without updated ERDs or data dictionaries, stakeholders will experience broken dashboards and incorrect KPIs.
- No communication exists for end-users about potential downtime or data access changes during the update window.

## Errors & Data Quality
- Missing migration dry-run results leave us blind to potential failures (constraint violations, orphaned rows, index rebuild costs). Production deployment could halt midway and corrupt data.
- Backup/restore procedures are undocumented. In the event of rollback, we have no assurance that snapshots cover the schema and data states pre-1.50.

## Integration
- External systems (ERP, HRIS, analytics pipelines) likely consume provider-related data. Without a mapping of impacted tables or API payload changes, downstream integrations will fail.
- There is no plan for handling ETL jobs that reference retired objects, risking nightly sync failures and data drift.

## Security
- Database role cleanup is unaccounted for; provider roles, service accounts, or row-level policies may still grant access to deprecated data.
- No mention of auditing or anonymising historical provider data, which could create compliance gaps if sensitive information remains in the system without a purpose.

## Alignment & Recommendations
- Strategic decision (provider retirement) is not reflected in executable database tasks, preventing alignment with compliance and reporting needs.
- **Action Items:**
  - Produce a migration dossier (DDL statements, rollback steps, archival plan) and obtain DBA sign-off.
  - Update data governance artefacts (ERDs, dictionary, access matrix) and communicate downstream impact.
  - Schedule backups, dry runs, and post-migration validation scripts before deployment.
