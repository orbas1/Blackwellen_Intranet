# Version 1.50 Update Change Log

## Governance & Documentation Alignment
- Published comprehensive programme governance pack including RACI matrix, steering cadence, and dependency tracker (`program_governance.md`).
- Updated backend documentation covering controller/service refactors, route changes, API contracts, and feature flag rollout plans.
- Refreshed design and UX artefacts with new wireframes, component specs, accessibility matrices, and logic flows aligned to adaptive experiences.
- Released API schema update pack with OpenAPI, GraphQL, gRPC definitions, migration guides, and communication templates.
- Prepared mobile release playbooks detailing build IDs, release schedule, localisation coverage, telemetry, and QA readiness.

## Backend Highlights
- Controller/service updates for adaptive home, directory, knowledge, service hub, analytics, and AI modules with telemetry instrumentation.
- Deprecation of provider endpoints with HTTP 410 responses, sunset headers, and migration guidance.
- Feature flag configuration enabling staged rollout for adaptive home preview, directory v2, knowledge attestation, service hub v2, and analytics stream.

## Frontend & Design Highlights
- Documented adaptive home widget grid, directory search experience, knowledge hub, service hub portal, analytics console, and admin console updates.
- Upgraded adaptive home experience with drag-and-drop widget personalisation, density controls, telemetry instrumentation, offline provenance banners, and quick action management aligned to design artefacts.
- Rebuilt the service hub portal with a filterable service catalog, SLA-aware intake wizard, offline submission fallback, and contextual knowledge suggestions stitched into workflow telemetry.
- Introduced analytics control tower route with KPI grids, SVG trend visualisation, alert acknowledgement workflow, report schedule governance, AI assistant recommendations, and security posture dashboards.
- Updated design system tokens, accessibility guidelines, and logic flows; progress reflected across design trackers and milestones.
- Introduced preference management context, directory virtualization, enriched knowledge filters, and global error handling in the intranet web client to support production data volumes and resilience expectations.

## Mobile Highlights
- Captured Android, iOS, and PWA release updates with build metadata, feature summaries, technical changes, testing, and rollout steps.
- Documented mobile screen changes, backend integration updates, widget behaviours, and change log for parity with web experience.
- Added analytics intelligence screen with dataset/timeframe/segment filters, cached KPI metrics, alert summaries, schedule visibility, and mobile security posture indicators aligned to web telemetry.
- Upgraded the React Native companion with React Query caching, AsyncStorage persistence, connectivity-aware messaging, and reusable offline components for dashboards, directory search, and knowledge consumption.
- Replaced bundled binary branding assets with a deterministic SVG-to-PNG generation pipeline executed during build/start commands to keep the repository text-only while ensuring consistent icons and splash screens across platforms.

## Compliance & Communication
- Communication templates distributed to partners and internal teams; partner certification plan established with monitoring and escalation paths.
- Readiness dashboard notes recorded for dependencies, risks, and mitigation actions.

## Architecture & Data Readiness Hardening
- Published enterprise dependency matrix with remediation workflow, security scan actions, and upgrade cadence covering backend, frontend, mobile, data, observability, and security platforms (`dependency_updates.md`).
- Documented infrastructure blueprint outlining CI/CD automation, security controls, DR strategy, and monitoring enhancements to support Version 1.50 deployments (`infrastructure_blueprint.md`, `build_updates.md`).
- Delivered database migration dossier detailing PostgreSQL 15 upgrade path, schema introductions, retention enforcement, validation scripts, and rollback procedures (`database_updates/migrations_updates.md`).
- Updated database change log, factories, and seeders to align QA/staging environments with new schemas, telemetry, and analytics datasets for release rehearsals (`database_updates/database_change_log.md`, `database_updates/factories_updates.md`, `database_updates/seeders_updates.md`).
- Finalised integration inventory capturing remediation actions, risk mitigation, and communication cadence for ERP, CRM, HRIS, communications, analytics, and notification connectors (`integration_inventory.md`).

## Application Foundations
- Added production-grade Vite/React adaptive intranet web client with widget orchestration, employee directory, knowledge hub, and service hub modules under `apps/web`.
- Delivered Expo-managed React Native companion app with navigation stack, adaptive widgets, offline directory/knowledge/service hub parity, and environment-aware theming under `apps/mobile`.
- Documented workspace onboarding and environment configuration updates in the refreshed repository README.
