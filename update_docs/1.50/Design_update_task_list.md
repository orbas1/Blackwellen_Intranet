# Version 1.50 Design Task List

> **Note**: Tasks span provider application, user application, and web portal surfaces. Each task includes coordination checkpoints with engineering, product, and compliance counterparts.

1. **Design System Unification & Token Expansion — 25%**
   - *Goal*: Refresh foundational tokens and component specs to support adaptive home, service hub, and analytics initiatives.
   - *Subtasks*:
     1. Audit existing colour, typography, spacing, and elevation tokens against new accessibility requirements.
     2. Publish unified token library covering light, dark, emo, and departmental palettes with fallback mapping.
     3. Document component anatomy and states for cards, buttons, forms, menus, and widgets across app and web contexts.
     4. Integrate token updates into design tooling (Figma libraries) and provide change notes to engineering repositories.
     5. Establish governance workflows for partial template updates and theme variant approvals.

2. **Navigation & Layout Architecture Redesign — 15%**
   - *Goal*: Recompose navigation structures and page frameworks for provider, user, and web experiences.
   - *Subtasks*:
     1. Produce adaptive navigation blueprints (mega menus, breadcrumbs, quick actions) aligned to `Organisation_and_positions` artefacts.
     2. Redesign home, directory, knowledge, and service hub layouts using modular sections and widget rails.
     3. Define responsive breakpoints, grid systems, and spacing rules for cross-device consistency.
     4. Validate navigation flows against updated logic diagrams and service escalations.

3. **Content, Copy, and Compliance Refresh — 10%**
   - *Goal*: Update textual assets, microcopy, and compliance messaging across all surfaces.
   - *Subtasks*:
     1. Draft copy decks for new analytics, AI, and service workflows with tone and localisation guidance.
     2. Embed compliance disclaimers, consent notices, and audit cues into key screens and pages.
     3. Align typography usage with revised scales and truncation behaviours to preserve readability.
     4. Coordinate legal, privacy, and security reviews before publishing final copy packages.

4. **Theming & Personalisation Enablement — 15%**
   - *Goal*: Deliver adaptive theme variants, emo themes, and personalisation controls.
   - *Subtasks*:
     1. Define theme matrices covering colour, typography, and motion settings for each variant.
     2. Configure partial template logic for departmental home pages and microsites.
     3. Design personalisation controls for layout toggles, widget pinning, and theme switching.
     4. Conduct accessibility validation for all themes, addressing contrast, focus, and animation preferences.
     5. Publish implementation guidance for engineers, including token mappings and runtime switching patterns.

5. **Asset & Media Optimisation — 10%**
   - *Goal*: Curate performant imagery, vectors, and iconography aligned to new experiences.
   - *Subtasks*:
     1. Inventory existing assets across application and web libraries, identifying gaps and redundancies.
     2. Produce new illustration and photography sets for adaptive home, service hub, and analytics scenarios.
     3. Optimise assets for multiple breakpoints (1x, 2x, 3x) and document compression guidelines.
     4. Update asset management documentation with CDN strategy, naming conventions, and usage rights.

6. **Design QA & Handover Enablement — 10%**
   - *Goal*: Ensure design fidelity through build and release by defining QA processes and artefacts.
   - *Subtasks*:
     1. Create design QA checklist covering responsiveness, accessibility, and component parity.
     2. Provide annotated specifications, redlines, and interaction notes for engineering consumption.
     3. Coordinate visual regression baselines and accessibility automation scripts with QA teams.
     4. Run design acceptance reviews on implemented screens/pages, logging deviations and remediation owners.
     5. Compile final design handover package including release notes, training materials, and support guidelines.

7. **Usability & Accessibility Validation — 5%**
   - *Goal*: Test new experiences with representative users and remediate findings before release.
   - *Subtasks*:
     1. Develop usability testing plan targeting adaptive home, service hub, and analytics workflows.
     2. Facilitate moderated sessions across desktop, mobile web, and native app contexts, capturing behavioural insights.
     3. Perform accessibility audits (WCAG 2.2 AA) across theme variants, recording issues and severity.
     4. Partner with engineering and QA to resolve usability and accessibility findings, confirming retests.

8. **Documentation & Training Delivery — 10%**
   - *Goal*: Produce comprehensive documentation and training materials for stakeholders and support teams.
   - *Subtasks*:
     1. Update design playbooks, component usage guides, and content governance manuals.
     2. Create training decks and video walkthroughs for support, operations, and communications teams.
     3. Document release communications, change impacts, and rollout checklists for design-led updates.
     4. Archive final artefacts in knowledge repositories with versioning and ownership metadata.
