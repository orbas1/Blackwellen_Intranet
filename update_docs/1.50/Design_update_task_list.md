     3. Design personalisation controls for layout toggles, widget pinning, and theme switching. âœ… Completed â€” captured in `Screens_Update.md` and logic flows.
     4. Conduct accessibility validation for all themes, addressing contrast, focus, and animation preferences. ðŸŸ¡ In Progress â€” Chromatic regression tests queued.
     5. Publish implementation guidance for engineers, including token mappings and runtime switching patterns. âšª Not Started â€” targeted for Week 4.

5. **Asset & Media Optimisation â€” 10%**
   - *Goal*: Curate performant imagery, vectors, and iconography aligned to new experiences.
   - *Subtasks*:

     2. Produce new illustration and photography sets for adaptive home, service hub, and analytics scenarios. âšª Not Started.
     3. Optimise assets for multiple breakpoints (1x, 2x, 3x) and document compression guidelines. âšª Not Started.
     4. Update asset management documentation with CDN strategy, naming conventions, and usage rights. ðŸŸ¡ In Progress â€” documented deterministic asset generation workflow; CDN policy pending analytics imagery sign-off.

6. **Design QA & Handover Enablement â€” 10%**
